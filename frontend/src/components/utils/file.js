The groups of people interacted with each other and eventually merged together, symbolized by the construction of the Servian Walls around the seven traditional hills of Rome."

Savage ('Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome', Vol. 17, (1940), pp. 26-56) and includes the Janiculum ridge and the lowland between it and the Tiber. The Trans Tiberim appears to have been the site of the annual ludi piscatorii (Fishermen's Games) held in honor of Father Tiber. Inscriptions show the games were held in the third century B.C. They were celebrated by the City Praetor."

1. Gondar Castle
Years of coverage in the media have left many people under the impression that Ethiopia is merely some arid landscape, but that entire narrative can be overturned in moments with a trip to Gondar, a settlement founded in the 17th Century, which is home to a castle of the same name. The castle was built for King Fasilides, and the town around it went on to become one of Ethiopia’s key agricultural towns. Buying a ticket for entry to the castle entitles you to a second visit, wherein you can see Fasilides’ Bath, a large, ornate ceremonial pool.
2. St. Georges Orthodox Cathedral
Located on Churchill Road in Addis Ababa, St. George’s Cathedral is a building of major importance for a number of reasons. Architecturally, it is an impressive octagonal structure, built on the ruins of a previous, 15th-century cathedral. Militarily, it was the scene of an attack by Italian forces in 1937, and was symbolically restored by Emperor Haile Selassie in 1941. In the present day, the cathedral houses a museum, with attractions including an imperial throne as well as some of the weaponry used in the Ethiopian-Italian war.
4. Bet Giyorgis Church
A near-neighbour of Kidus Mikael is the spectacular Bet Giyorgis Church; hewn out of the rock in Lalibela, the church (whose name translates from Amharic as “St. George”) is one of the most commonly photographed sites in all of Ethiopia. The church is a common pilgrimage site for members of Ethiopian congregations spread worldwide; those who have made pilgrimage to the site are entitled to be laid to rest here when their life is at an end.
5. Yeha Temple
One of many historical religious sites within Ethiopia - and among the most interesting to religious scholars - Yeha Temple is understood to date from as far back as the 8th Century BCE. Ethiopia is understood to have been one of the first countries to embrace Christianity as its religion, and there is evidence that the temple, for some time, served as one of the country’s first Orthodox churches. Although the church is a ruin today, much of the original structure still stands, and is a fascinating monument to Ethiopia’s varied religious past.
7. Awash Valley
One of Ethiopia’s designated UNESCO World Heritage sites, the Awash Valley is an imposing geographical feature through which flows the river of the same name. The valley has been the site for a number of significant historical digs, many of which have found human remains dating back millennia. One dig, in 1974, found 52 fragments of a skeleton which the anthropologists nicknamed “Lucy”, and which were dated to 3.2 million years of age.
8. Gebre Meskel Tombs
Among archaeologists, it is widely accepted that one of the most interesting phases of African architecture is the Aksumite period, and for many, the best example of the genre is found at the tomb complex of Gebre Meskel, a king who ruled in the 6th century. The precision of the carvings and the construction is beyond anything found elsewhere in Aksum, and consists of a chamber with five rooms - of which one has a beautifully finished portal. Within that room lie three decorated sarcophagi; one of these may contain the remains of Gebre Meskel - but, according to legend, he may also be buried at Debre Damo, a two-hour drive away!
9. Queen of Sheba’s Palace
The Queen of Sheba is a mysterious figure whose first appearance in literature appears to come in the Hebrew Bible, although scholars have cast debate on whether she was a real-life queen or a mythical figure. Regardless, there are numerous historical sites worldwide with a claim to being palaces - or, more frequently, the ruins of a palace - that belonged to her. This one, in Aksum, is a popular site of worship for the substantial Ethiopian Jewish population, and covers upwards of 3,250 square metres (34,982 square feet). Regardless of whether the queen lived here, or ever lived at all, the ruins of this palace are a spectacular sight.
